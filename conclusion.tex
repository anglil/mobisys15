\section{conclusion}
In this paper, we have presented a bi-directional VLC system called \retro that consists of a modified LED and a tag device. The tag can run battery-free by harvesting light energy with solar cells. The \vitag\ transmits by reflecting and modulating incoming light back to the LED using a retro-reflector and an LCD modulator. The system overcomes the power consumption challenge on the \vitag and interferences and clock offsets on the LED end, achieving $10kbps$ downlink rate and $0.5kbps$ uplink rate over a distance up to $2.4m$. The system also shows security advantages, preventing readers nearby from overhearing uplink data. We believe \retro have wide application scenarios.
