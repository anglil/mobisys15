\p{liqul: we should have a dedicated section like "Trade-off of sizes" discussing how we partition the constrained board size into two retro-reflector and solar cell. The intuition is that we should not assign too much space to either side. There should be an optimal partitioning. Not sure if our current design is optimal.}

\subsection{Prototype Implementation}
\q{Overly too much details. Mentioning key modules are good enough. For the concrete values, it's better to put them on the figure. }


To evaluate the performance of our \retro\ in practice, we implement the \vitag\ and the modified \reader\ system on printed circuit boards (PCBs) using off-the-shelf circuit components, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:system}. It is a fully reconfigurable platform controlled by firmware executed on the low power MSP430 microcontroller on the \vitag\ and the powerful Cortex M4 microcontroller in the \reader. 

The \reader\ is implemented with an \hl{Apollo BR30-12W white light bulb}. MSP430 generated signal modulates the light using a TI HC04 HEX inverter. Then we use an IRF510 MOSFET to implement an RF power amplifier. The amplified signal is sent to an array of $24\times 0.5W$ photo diodes to be transmitted.

The implementation of the \vitag\ starts with a BPW34 PIN photodiode. The captured signal is sent to a bandpass filter that contains a $281uH$ inductor, and then an amplifier implemented with a 9018 transistor. The next amplifier also employs a 9018, as well as an inductor of $100uH$ for further filtering. After the amplification comes the demodulator, which is implemented with a current source using a \qm{9018}, and a RC filter driven by another 9018. This demodulated signal is sent to a comparator implemented using a TLV2762 Operational Amplifier (Op Amp), before the decoding process with an MSP430.

In the \vitag\ transmitting phase, an SF110147 LCD is used, covering a retro-reflector fabric. For the energy reuse module, we use an SS14 diode to prevent the waste of the current and directs it to the recycling capacitor, and we use a BQ25504 to implement the DC-DC charge pump.

The \reader\ receiver uses an SFH213 light sensor, parallel with an LC parallel resonant circuit, where $C=200pF$, and $L=100\mu H$. It's followed by an impedance matching circuit that matches a transmission line with a $33\Omega$ input impedance that decouples the RF interferences. Then we implement the band pass filter using a differential design with 9018s, whose gain is controlled by the Cortex M4. The two amplifiers that follow are also implemented with 9018s. Finally, the envelope detector and the comparator are implemented using an LM6172 with two Op Amps inside, along with 1N60 diodes.

Table~\ref{table:energy} compares the energy distribution over the receiving phase and the transmitting phase on the \vitag. The table shows that
