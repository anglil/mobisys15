\section{conclusion}
In this paper, we have presented a bi-directional VLC system called \retro that consists of a modified LED (\reader) and a tag device (\vitag). The tag can run battery-free by harvesting light energy via solar cells. The \vitag\ transmits by reflecting and modulating incoming light back to the LED using a retro-reflector and an LCD modulator. The system overcomes the power consumption challenge on the \vitag and interferences and clock offsets on the LED end, \fyi{achieving $10kbps$ downlink rate and $0.5kbps$ uplink rate over a distance up to $2.2m$.} The system also shows security advantages, preventing readers nearby from overhearing uplink data. We believe \retro have wide application scenarios.
